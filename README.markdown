# Aliases for rbenv Ruby versions

Invoke `rbenv alias <name> <version>` to make a symbolic link from `<name>` to
`<version>` in the [rbenv][] versions directory, effectively creating an
alias.  The cool part is that if you pass in a point release as the name, you
can give `--auto` to link to the latest installed patch level.  For example,
`rbenv alias 1.8.7 --auto` will automatically create an alias from `1.8.7` to
`1.8.7-p371` (or whatever the most recent version you have installed is).

Plus, if you're using [ruby-build][], `rbenv install A.B.C-pXXX` automatically
invokes `rbenv alias A.B.C --auto`, so you'll always have up to date aliases
for point releases.

Whether it's a good idea to use these aliases in a `.ruby-version` file, I
cannot say.  I created this plugin to find out.  If your only concern is
having to reinstall gems every time you install a new patch release, check out
[rbenv-communal-gems][].
